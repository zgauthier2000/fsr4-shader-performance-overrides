# fsr4-shader-performance-overrides

Makes AMD FSR 4.1.1 upscaling faster on Radeon graphics cards, on Windows and Linux, by replacing
FSR 4's slowest shaders with faster ones. One file to swap, nothing else in the game changes.

## Quick start

> [!WARNING]
> **Never use this in online games or in any game with anti-cheat.** These are modified game files. Anti-cheat
> software can treat a changed DLL or changed shaders as tampering, and that can get an account banned. Use it in
> single-player games only.

**1. Download the zip for your graphics card.**

| Your graphics card | Download |
|---|---|
| A Radeon **RX 7000 or RX 6000** graphics card: the name has "RX" and a four-digit number, such as RX 7800 XT or RX 6700 XT. This includes gaming laptops with their own RX chip (RX 7700S, RX 6700M and the like) | **[fsr4.1.1-cyboman.zip](https://github.com/zgauthier2000/fsr4-shader-performance-overrides/releases/latest/download/fsr4.1.1-cyboman.zip)** |
| **Graphics built into the processor:** most laptops, mini PCs and handhelds. The name is "Radeon Graphics" or "Radeon" with a three-digit number, such as Radeon 780M or 890M; also the Steam Deck | **[fsr4.1.1-igpu-cyboman.zip](https://github.com/zgauthier2000/fsr4-shader-performance-overrides/releases/latest/download/fsr4.1.1-igpu-cyboman.zip)** |
| Radeon RX 9000 | not for these cards: they run a different FSR 4. Do not install it there. |

Not sure which you have? In Windows, open Task Manager, go to Performance and look at the GPU's name; on a
laptop with two, the RX one is the one games use.

**2. Choose a version.** Each zip holds two folders with one file each:

| Folder | Speed | Picture |
|---|---|---|
| `exact` | faster than AMD's | **the same as AMD's, byte for byte** |
| `lossy` | faster again | very close to AMD's, but not the same. Read `WARNING.txt` in that folder first |

If you are not sure, take `exact`.

**3. Put the file in the game's folder.** The game must already run FSR 4.1.1, for example through
[OptiScaler](https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler).

1. Find `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll` in the game's folder (often next to OptiScaler) and
   rename it to `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll.orig`. It must be version 4.1.1.2740.
2. Copy the `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll` from the folder you chose into its place.

This works on Windows and, under Proton, on Linux. Linux users can instead use
[one launch option](#linux-a-launch-option-instead-of-the-dll) and leave the DLL alone.

**4. Check that it worked.** Open OptiScaler's overlay in the game. The FSR version reads
`4.1.1-cyboman` (or `4.1.1-lossy-cyboman`; with the other zip `4.1.1-igpu-cyboman` or
`4.1.1-igpu-lossy-cyboman`), and the upscaler time is lower than before.

**To undo it,** delete the file and rename the `.orig` file back.

## What to expect

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/img/quickstart-dark.svg">
  <img src="docs/img/quickstart-light.svg" width="760" alt="What to expect at 4K on a Radeon RX 7800 XT in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, FSR 4.1.1 Balanced. AMD's shaders: 4.16 milliseconds of upscaling per frame, 97 frames per second. Exact DLL: 2.99 milliseconds, 109 frames per second, same picture byte for byte. Lossy DLL: 2.06 milliseconds, 122 frames per second, very close picture, opt-in. Other resolutions and other cards give other numbers.">
</picture>

- **The gain depends on the output resolution.** It is largest at 4K. At 1440p and 1080p the exact
  DLL's gain depends on the card: some keep most of it (an RX 7900 XT 30% at 1440p, an RX 6600 XT 24% at 1080p),
  others show little or nothing (the RX 7800 XT and an RX 7900 XTX at 1080p). The lossy DLL helps at every size,
  because it skips work instead of only doing the same work faster.
- **It depends on your graphics chip, too.** FSR 4 time saved at 4K, from testers' timing-kit runs and game reports
  so far:

  | Graphics chip | Exact DLL | Lossy DLL |
  |---|---|---|
  | Radeon RX 7000 | 15 to 35% in most reports; about 2% in two RX 7800 XT reports | 29 to 49% |
  | Radeon RX 6000 | from nothing to about 30% | 23 to 48% |
  | Integrated graphics and handhelds | from a few percent slower to 6% faster | 23 to 35% |
  | Intel Arc B580 (one report) | 6 to 8% | 31% |
  | GeForce RTX 3060 Ti (one report) | none | 34% |

  We do not yet know what decides where a card falls in its range. Most rows rest on a handful of single runs.
  [Results by graphics chip](docs/results.md#by-gpu-type), [timing kit results](timing-kit/RESULTS.md).
- **It only shows when the graphics card is the limit.** If the processor limits your frame rate,
  the frame rate does not change.
- **The exact DLL cannot change the picture.** Its output was compared with AMD's byte for byte at
  720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K and 5K, in still and moving scenes. One intended exception: on RX 6000 cards under
  Windows, AMD's own file shows ghosting, and the exact DLL carries the fix, so its picture differs from AMD's there.
- **The lossy DLL trades a little accuracy for speed.** It runs FSR 4's neural network on every
  other frame and carries its result along with the picture's motion in between. Measured
  differences and comparison crops: [exact and lossy compared](docs/exact-vs-lossy.md). What the
  alternating cost means for frame caps and V-Sync: [frame pacing](docs/frame-pacing.md).

One card, one game, as an example of the best case: a Radeon RX 7800 XT, Shadow of the Tomb Raider's benchmark, 4K
output, FSR 4.1.1 Balanced. Your card and your game will give other numbers:

| | FSR 4 time per frame | Frame rate | Picture |
|---|---|---|---|
| AMD's shaders | 4.16 ms | 97 FPS | the reference |
| Exact | 2.99 ms (−28%) | 109 FPS (+12%) | identical |
| Lossy | 2.06 ms (−50%) | 122 FPS (+26%) | still picture within 0.2 dB of AMD's |

More games and resolutions: [all results](docs/results.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **Two settings where you will see little or no gain:**
> - **FSR's debug view (the overlay that draws FSR's watermark and debug panels).** The faster shaders do not cover the
>   debug versions of FSR's last pass, so AMD's own slow one runs and most of the gain is gone. Switch the debug view off
>   to measure or to play.
> - **Ultra Performance mode.** The lossy DLL does not skip frames there, so it is no faster than the exact DLL. The
>   exact DLL's own gain still applies.

## New in this release

**[See what this release changes against the previous one, in pictures and figures →](docs/releases/dll-2026-10-14.md)**

> [!TIP]
> **The lossy DLL: slow fades keep up better, small dark things pulse less, and less of an old image is left beside moving objects.**
> - **Slow fades** (a scene growing lighter or darker with nothing moving): bright flat areas followed them up to half a frame later than with
>   AMD's shaders. Now brightening is 0.64 frames behind where it was 0.87 (AMD's 0.46), darkening 0.68 where it was 0.82 (AMD's 0.62).
>   [Details on the release page](docs/releases/dll-2026-10-14.md).
> - **Small dark things that move without motion vectors** (dark leaves falling in front of a dark sky): with the camera
>   still they are shown more fully on the frames that skip the network (75.5% to 77.5% of the leaf; AMD's shaders 79.1%), and the
>   trace they leave is a little shorter (8.4% to 7.9%; AMD's 5.4%). A change now counts where it lasts two frames, which film grain
>   rarely does. While the camera pans nothing changes.
> - **Beside moving objects** the last shader keeps less of their old image: the outline of an object moving in front of a
>   still camera 1.30 to 1.15 (AMD's 1.07), a still object over fast ground 2.64 to 2.26 (1.62), thin bars fixed on screen in
>   front of a pan 0.91 to 0.86 (0.82).
> - **The price:** flat areas at rest change about a third more per frame and a moving background about a fifth more (both still
>   steadier than with AMD's shaders); the railing of the panning test scene flickers up to 3% more and strong film grain is about 5% less
>   steady with auto exposure off.
> - **Speed:** up to 0.02 ms more per frame at 4K (under 1%). The exact DLL is unchanged.
> - **In a game:** Shadow of the Tomb Raider's benchmark at 4K Balanced on a Radeon RX 7800 XT under Linux, one run: 18,891 frames and 122 FPS,
>   the overlay's average upscaler time 2.06 ms (`dll-2026-10-13.2`: 18,849 frames, 122 FPS, 2.01 ms), level within one run's scatter.
>   Also tested in the test rig (Linux files, and the DLLs under Proton) and the timing kit.
> - **[The lossy DLL beside FSR 3.1, HelixSR and XeSS](docs/upscaler-comparison.md):** the same test scenes and the same
>   timing for all five, with one chart per upscaler and side-by-side crops. It shows where the
>   lossy DLL leads (accuracy close to FSR 4, areas a moving object has just uncovered, slowly swaying foliage, where it
>   is second only to FSR 4) and where it is weakest (fast-moving foliage, the brightness of a thin wire in a camera pan).

<a href="docs/releases/dll-2026-10-14.md"><img src="docs/img/rel-2026-10-14-plate.png" width="100%" alt="A white object stays still at the same depth as ground that moves down by 100 pixels per frame; the piece of ground just below it, enlarged 3 times, in the true image, with AMD's shaders, with the lossy DLL of dll-2026-10-13.2 and with that of dll-2026-10-14, on frame 39, a frame the lossy DLL skips the network for. Below each picture, its error against the true image amplified 16 times. With dll-2026-10-13.2 two bright rectangles of leftover image show where the object's dark notches used to be (error 2.53 of 255 where the object's old image lands); with dll-2026-10-14 they are much fainter (1.91), close to AMD's shaders (1.87)."></a>

The change in this release that shows most in a single picture: a still object over ground that moves fast. One frame (39) of a made-up test scene, single run; the error under each picture is measured where the object's old image lands, on this frame. Over the whole scene it goes from 2.64 to 2.26 (AMD's 1.62). The fades gain more in figures, but a lag does not show in a still picture: [the release page](docs/releases/dll-2026-10-14.md) has them as a chart, with every change, what got worse and what was not checked. [The upscaler comparison page](docs/upscaler-comparison.md) sets this release's lossy DLL beside FSR 3.1, HelixSR and XeSS, with the figures and the scenes it does worst in.

> ### Help test it: the timing kit
> **[Download the Windows timing kit](https://github.com/zgauthier2000/fsr4-shader-performance-overrides/releases/download/timing-kit-2026-10-14/fsr4-timing-kit-windows.zip)** (experimental, 190 MB, version 2026-10-14): unpack, double-click
> `fsr4time.exe`, wait 15 to 20 minutes. It times FSR 4 with AMD's shaders and with these DLLs on your graphics card, checks
> that each DLL gives the same picture, and offers to send the result. Reports are in from eleven graphics chips so far;
> every further card helps, including GeForce and Intel Arc. On Linux and the Steam Deck: [the Linux kit](timing-kit).
>
> - The kits (2026-10-14) carry this release's lossy build. If you ran a kit older than 2026-10-13, please run again.
> - Optional: the kit asks for a name or nickname for the [thank-you page](docs/thanks.md).

## Will it work for me?

| Graphics card | Which zip | Status |
|---|---|---|
| RX 7900, 7800, 7700, 7600 (desktop RDNA3) | `fsr4.1.1-cyboman.zip` | measured here on an RX 7800 XT; testers report large gains on Windows |
| RX 6000 (RDNA2) | `fsr4.1.1-cyboman.zip` | runs, and includes the fix for the shimmering these cards show with AMD's file; at 4K, reports with the exact DLL range from a few percent to about 30%, and we do not yet know what decides it; a few percent at 1440p and below (tester reports) |
| Radeon 780M, 890M and other integrated graphics, Steam Deck | `fsr4.1.1-igpu-cyboman.zip` | experimental: few reports, small gains |
| RX 9000 (RDNA4) | none | no: a different FSR 4 runs there ([open for someone to pick up](docs/rdna4.md)) |
| Any other graphics chip: Nvidia GeForce, Intel Arc and Intel integrated graphics, older Radeon | `fsr4.1.1-cyboman.zip`; for a chip built into the processor try `fsr4.1.1-igpu-cyboman.zip` first | **should run, untested.** FSR 4.1.1's shaders are ordinary DirectX 12 compute shaders: they need Shader Model 6.6 with 8-bit integer dot products, 16-bit types and wave operations, which current drivers from all three makers provide. Users report the DLLs running on a GeForce laptop and on an Arc A770. Nothing has been measured there: the rewrites were made for Radeon chips, so they may or may not be faster than AMD's shaders, and "same picture" has only been verified on Radeon. A [timing-kit](timing-kit/README.md#windows-experimental) result tells both |

You also need a DirectX 12 game in which FSR 4.1.1 already runs, with
`amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_dx12.dll` version 4.1.1.2740.

Both DLLs have AMD's graphics-card check lifted (AMD's own file offers this FSR 4 only on desktop
RX 7000 cards), so they start on any card whose driver can run the shaders: DirectX 12 with Shader
Model 6.6. That is also why they must not go on an RX 9000 card, where a different FSR 4 would
then start as well.

If the first zip is slower than AMD's file on a small RX 6000 card, try the second one: it differs
only in one shader that is built smaller. Details: [GPU support](docs/gpu-support.md).

## Linux: a launch option instead of the DLL

On Linux you can leave AMD's DLL in place and give the game the replacement shaders directly.

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. In Steam, add this to the game's launch options (keep anything already there in front of
   `%command%`):

   ```
   VKD3D_SHADER_OVERRIDE='Z:/path/to/fsr4-shader-performance-overrides/prebuilt' %command%
   ```

   `Z:` is how Proton sees your Linux root, so `Z:/home/you/...` is `/home/you/...`. For the lossy
   version use the folder `prebuilt-lossy` instead, after reading the `WARNING.txt` in it.

- **The game must be using AMD's original DLL.** The launch option does nothing while a DLL from
  this project is installed, because the files are matched to AMD's shaders.
- **The version name does not change** with the launch option; OptiScaler shows plain `4.1.1`.
  The upscaler time is how you tell it applied.
- **The prebuilt files do not fit every setup.** They were made on an RX 7000 desktop card. On
  one tester's RX 6900 XT, Proton laid the same shaders out differently and the picture came out
  darker. If the picture looks wrong, build your own files:
  [Linux guide](docs/linux.md#building-your-own). `./tools/check_prebuilt.sh <dump folder>` tells you
  whether the prebuilt files fit.

If it does not get faster: [Linux guide](docs/linux.md).

## More about the files

Each DLL is AMD's own file with the rewritten shaders swapped in and the version name changed.
How that is done, and how to build it yourself: [`dll/`](dll). There is also a ReShade add-on
that does the same without touching the DLL: [`windows/`](windows).

The scripts that rewrite the Linux shaders and build the files in `prebuilt/` are in [`tools/`](tools)
(they were in the top folder until release `dll-2026-10-11.3`; commands in older posts need `tools/` in front).

**In some games OptiScaler's upscaler time is only reliable with the frame rate uncapped.** If
nothing changes at all, check that the game really runs FSR 4.1.1 with AMD's DLL version
4.1.1.2740; other versions have different shaders. See [shader variants](docs/variants.md).

## Good to know

- **Nothing else changes.** No game files are edited, and the output was compared byte for byte
  with AMD's at 4K, 1440p and 1080p.
- **Game and OptiScaler updates** can put the original DLL back; the launch option keeps working.
- **Never in online games or games with anti-cheat.** This changes the shaders the game renders with, and anti-cheat
  software can treat that as tampering. Single-player games only.
- **Linux:** do not set `RADV_PERFTEST=cswave32` for a game that runs FSR 4; it adds about 1.1 ms.
